## Description

The 0x15-file_io project is part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum. This project explores the concept of file input/output operations, which involves reading from and writing to files using the C programming language.

In this project, we learn various file I/O functions provided by the C standard library, such as `open`, `close`, `read`, and `write`. We also explore how to handle file errors and implement error-checking mechanisms when performing file operations.

File I/O is an essential skill in low-level programming, as it allows us to interact with files, manipulate their content, and perform tasks like reading configuration files, logging data, or processing large datasets stored in files.

Through the tasks in this project, you will gain a solid understanding of file I/O concepts and apply them to perform file-related operations.

## Project Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on different aspects of file I/O. The tasks include:

1. 0. 0-read_textfile.c
2. 1. 1-create_file.c
3. 2. 2-append_text_to_file.c
4. 3. 3-cp.c

Each task involves implementing C code that performs specific file I/O operations and achieves the desired functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with the 0x15-file_io project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the "0x15-file_io" directory:
   ```
   cd alx-low_level_programming/0x15-file_io
   ```

3. Explore the individual task files (e.g., "main.h", "0-read_textfile.c", etc.) and implement the required code to complete each task.

4. Compile and run the C files to test your implementations.

5. Repeat the process for each task, ensuring that you meet the task's requirements and expected output.

6. Once you have completed the tasks, you can submit your solutions for review and evaluation.

Feel free to experiment and explore additional file I/O operations and use cases to further enhance your understanding.
