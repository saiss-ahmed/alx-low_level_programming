# README FOR C - Recursion

## Learning Objectives:
* What is recursion and how to use it
* The difference between recursive and iterative functions
* How to use recursion to implement mathematical concepts

## This repository contains:

#### - [0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/0-puts_recursion.c)
- A function that prints a string, followed by a new line, using recursion.

#### - [1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/1-print_rev_recursion.c)
- A function that prints a string in reverse, using recursion.

#### - [2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/2-strlen_recursion.c)
- A function that returns the length of a string, using recursion.

#### - [3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/3-factorial.c)
- A function that returns the factorial of a given number, using recursion.

#### - [4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/4-pow_recursion.c)
- A function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`, using recursion.

#### - [5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/5-sqrt_recursion.c)
- A function that returns the natural square root of a number, using recursion.

#### - [6. Inception. Is it possible?](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/6-is_prime_number.c)
- A function that checks if a number is a prime number, using recursion.

#### - [7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/100-is_palindrome.c)
- A function that checks if a string is a palindrome, using recursion.

#### - [8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/101-wildcmp.c)
- A function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise returns 0.

#### - [9. The task ahead of us is never as great as the power behind us](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/holberton.h)
- A header file containing the function prototypes used in the various files.
