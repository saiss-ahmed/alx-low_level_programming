# README FOR C - More Functions, More Nested Loops

## Learning Objectives:
* What are nested loops and how to use them
* What are functions and how to use them
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* What is a prototype
* Scope of variables
* What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra
* What are header files and how to use them with #include

## This repository contains:

#### - [0. isupper](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/0-isupper.c)
- A function that checks for uppercase characters.

#### - [1. isdigit](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/1-isdigit.c)
- A function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

#### - [2. Collaboration is multiplication](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/2-mul.c)
- A function that multiplies two integers.

#### - [3. The numbers speak for themselves](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/3-print_numbers.c)
- A function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9.

#### - [4. I believe in numbers and signs](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/4-print_most_numbers.c)
- A function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, excluding 2 and 4.

#### - [5. Numbers constitute the only universal language](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/5-more_numbers.c)
- A function that prints the numbers from 0 to 14, ten times.

#### - [6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/6-print_line.c)
- A function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

#### - [7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/7-print_diagonal.c)
- A function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal.

#### - [8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/8-print_square.c)
- A function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

#### - [9. Fizz-Buzz](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/9-fizz_buzz.c)
- A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of five, it prints "Buzz", and for numbers which are multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz".

#### - [10. Triangles](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/10-print_triangle.c)
- A function that prints a triangle of a given size.
