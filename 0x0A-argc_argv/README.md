# README FOR C - argc, argv

## Learning Objectives:
* What are command line arguments and how to use them
* How to manipulate the `argc` and `argv` variables
* What are two prototypes of `main` that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
* How to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters
