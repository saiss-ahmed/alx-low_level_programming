## Description

The 0x0D-preprocessor project is part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum. In this project, we explore the preprocessor and its functionalities in C programming.

The preprocessor is a tool that processes source code before it is compiled. It performs various operations, such as macro expansion, file inclusion, and conditional compilation, to modify the source code before it is passed to the compiler.

By completing the tasks in this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of the preprocessor directives, macros, and how to use them effectively in your programs.

## Project Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on different aspects of the preprocessor. The tasks include:

1. 0. Object-like Macro
2. 1. Pi
3. 2. File Name
4. 3. Function-like Macro
5. 4. SUM
6. 5. Worst Abuse of the C Preprocessor (IOCCC winner, 1986)
7. 101. Preprocessor Compilation

Each task involves writing C code that utilizes preprocessor directives or macros to achieve the desired functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with the 0x0D-preprocessor project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the "0x0D-preprocessor" directory:
   ```
   cd alx-low_level_programming/0x0D-preprocessor
   ```

3. Explore the individual task files (e.g., "0-object_like_macro.h", "1-pi.h", etc.) and implement the required code to complete each task.

4. Compile and run the C files to test your implementations.

5. Repeat the process for each task, making sure to check the task's requirements and expected output.

6. Once you have completed the tasks, you can submit your solutions for review and evaluation.

Feel free to experiment and explore additional use cases of the preprocessor directives and macros to deepen your understanding.
