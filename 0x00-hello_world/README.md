* What happens when you type gcc main.c
* What is an entry point
* What is main
* How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
* How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
* How to compile using gcc
* What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
* What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
* How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
* How does the main function influence the return value of the program

#### - [0. Preprocessor](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor)
 - a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.

#### - [1. Compiler](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler)
 - a script that compiles a C file but does not link.

#### - [2. Assembler](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler)
 -  a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.

#### - [3. Name](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/3-name)
 -  a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.

#### - [4. Hello, puts](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c)
 -  a C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.

#### - [5. Hello, printf](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c)
 - a C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.

#### - [6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c)
 -  a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

#### - [7. Intel](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/100-intel)
 - a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.


#### - [8. UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/101-quote.c)
 - a C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
