#### - [0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c)
 - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
#### - [1. The last digit](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c)
 - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
#### - [2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c)

#### - [6. Numberz](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c)
 -  a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
#### - [7. Smile in the mirror](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c)
 - a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
#### - [8. Hexadecimal](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c)
 - a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
#### - [9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c)
 -  a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
#### - [10. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/100-print_comb3.c)
 - a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
#### - [11. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do...](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/101-print_comb4.c)
 - a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.
