## the purpose of this repository :
this repo was made to lean C programming language, 
### what is C ?
C programming language is a widely used programming language that was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in 1972. It is a general-purpose, high-level language that is used to develop operating systems, database systems, compilers, and other system software. C is a compiled language, meaning that the source code is translated into machine code by a compiler before execution. It is known for its efficiency, portability, and low-level memory access, which makes it suitable for system-level programming. C has influenced many programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python.
### here is some facts  about C 
*  C was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs for the purpose of writing the UNIX operating system.

* C is a general-purpose programming language that is used for system programming, embedded systems, and application programming.

* C is a compiled language, which means that the code you write is converted into machine language by a compiler before it can be executed.

* C is known for its efficiency, speed, and flexibility, making it popular in areas such as operating systems, network programming, and game development.

* C is a low-level language, which means that it provides direct access to the computer's hardware, allowing for precise control over system resources.

* C has influenced many other programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python.

* C is still widely used today, particularly in system programming and embedded systems, despite the development of newer programming languages.

* The C Standard Library provides a set of functions for common operations, such as string manipulation, memory allocation, and input/output.

* C has a relatively simple syntax and is easy to learn, making it a good choice for beginners who want to learn programming.

* C has had a significant impact on the development of modern computing and remains an important language for programmers and computer scientists today.
