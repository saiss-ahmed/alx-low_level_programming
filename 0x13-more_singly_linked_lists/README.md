## Description

The 0x13-more_singly_linked_lists project is part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum. In this project, we dive deeper into the world of singly linked lists and implement additional operations to enhance their functionality.

Singly linked lists are linear data structures where each element, known as a node, contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the list. In this project, we extend our knowledge of linked lists by implementing more advanced operations, such as inserting nodes at specific positions, reversing lists, and sorting lists.

Through the tasks in this project, you will further strengthen your understanding of linked lists and gain hands-on experience with complex operations on singly linked lists.

## Project Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on different advanced operations and functionalities of singly linked lists. The tasks include:

1. 0. Print list (revised)
2. 1. List length (revised)
3. 2. Add node (revised)
4. 3. Add node at the end (revised)
5. 4. Free list (revised)
6. 5. The Hare and the Tortoise (revised)
7. 6. Real programmers can write assembly code in any language
8. 7. Willie the mascot
9. 8. The key to success is to start before you are ready
10. 9. FizzBuzz

Each task involves implementing C code that manipulates singly linked lists to achieve the desired functionality. The revised tasks build upon the previous tasks from the 0x12-singly_linked_lists project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the 0x13-more_singly_linked_lists project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the "0x13-more_singly_linked_lists" directory:
   ```
   cd alx-low_level_programming/0x13-more_singly_linked_lists
   ```

3. Explore the individual task files (e.g., "lists.h", "0-print_listint.c", etc.) and implement the required code to complete each task.

4. Compile and run the C files to test your implementations.

5. Repeat the process for each task, ensuring that you meet the task's requirements and expected output.

6. Once you have completed the tasks, you can submit your solutions for review and evaluation.

Feel free to experiment and explore additional use cases of singly linked lists to further enhance your understanding.
