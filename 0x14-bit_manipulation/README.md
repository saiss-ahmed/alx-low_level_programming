## Description

The 0x14-bit_manipulation project is part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum. This project explores the concept of bit manipulation, which involves performing operations on individual bits of binary data.

In this project, we learn various techniques and operations to manipulate bits, including setting, clearing, toggling, and getting the value of specific bits. We also work with bitwise operators, such as AND, OR, XOR, and shift operators, to perform bitwise operations on binary data.

Bit manipulation is an essential skill in low-level programming, as it allows us to optimize code, perform efficient calculations, and work with hardware interfaces that deal with individual bits.

Through the tasks in this project, you will gain a solid understanding of bit manipulation techniques and apply them to solve specific problems.

## Project Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on different aspects of bit manipulation. The tasks include:

1. 0. 0-binary_to_uint.c
2. 1. 1-print_binary.c
3. 2. 10-get_endianness.c
4. 3. 100-get_bit.c
5. 4. 101-set_bit.c
6. 5. 110-clear_bit.c
7. 6. 111-flip_bits.c
8. 7. 100-get_endianness.c
9. 8. 101-password

Each task involves implementing C code that performs specific bit manipulation operations and achieves the desired functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with the 0x14-bit_manipulation project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the "0x14-bit_manipulation" directory:
   ```
   cd alx-low_level_programming/0x14-bit_manipulation
   ```

3. Explore the individual task files (e.g., "main.h", "0-binary_to_uint.c", etc.) and implement the required code to complete each task.

4. Compile and run the C files to test your implementations.

5. Repeat the process for each task, ensuring that you meet the task's requirements and expected output.

6. Once you have completed the tasks, you can submit your solutions for review and evaluation.

Feel free to experiment and explore additional use cases of bit manipulation to further enhance your understanding.
