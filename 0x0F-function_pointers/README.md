## Description

The 0x0F-function_pointers project is part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum. In this project, we explore the concept of function pointers and their usage in C.

In C, functions are treated as first-class citizens, which means they can be passed as arguments to other functions and returned from functions. Function pointers allow us to store the address of a function and invoke it later through the pointer.

By completing the tasks in this project, you will learn how to declare and use function pointers, as well as understand their practical applications in C programming.

## Project Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on different aspects of function pointers. The tasks include:

1. 0. What's my name
2. 1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done
3. 2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities
4. 3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at.
5. 4. Most hackers are young because young people tend to be adaptable. As long as you remain adaptable, you can always be a good hacker.
6. 5. The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit.
7. 6. I will show you how great I am.

Each task involves writing C code that utilizes function pointers to achieve the desired functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with the 0x0F-function_pointers project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the "0x0F-function_pointers" directory:
   ```
   cd alx-low_level_programming/0x0F-function_pointers
   ```

3. Explore the individual task files (e.g., "function_pointers.h", "3-main.c", etc.) and implement the required code to complete each task.

4. Compile and run the C files to test your implementations.

5. Repeat the process for each task, making sure to check the task's requirements and expected output.

6. Once you have completed the tasks, you can submit your solutions for review and evaluation.

Feel free to experiment and explore additional use cases of function pointers to deepen your understanding.
