# README FOR C - malloc, free

## Learning Objectives:
* What is the `malloc` function and how to use it
* Why and when to use `malloc`
* How to use `valgrind` to check for memory leak

## This repository contains:

#### - [0. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0B-malloc_free/0-create_array.c)
- A function that creates an array of characters and initializes it with a specific character.

#### - [1. The woman who has no imagination has no wings](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0B-malloc_free/1-strdup.c)
- A function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

#### - [2. He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0B-malloc_free/2-str_concat.c)
- A function that concatenates two strings.

#### - [3. If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0B-malloc_free/3-alloc_grid.c)
- A function that returns a pointer to a 2D array of integers.

#### - [4. It's not bragging if you can back it up](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0B-malloc_free/4-free_grid.c)
