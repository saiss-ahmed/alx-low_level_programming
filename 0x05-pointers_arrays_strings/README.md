# README FOR C - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

## Learning Objectives:
* What are pointers and how to use them
* What are arrays and how to use them
* What are the differences between pointers and arrays
* How to use strings and how to manipulate them
* Scope of variables
* What are the `gcc` flags `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra`
* What are the common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

## This repository contains:

#### - [0. 98 Battery st.](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/0-reset_to_98.c)
- A function that takes a pointer to an int as a parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

#### - [1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/1-swap.c)
- A function that swaps the values of two integers.

#### - [2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strlen.c)
- A function that returns the length of a string.

#### - [3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/3-puts.c)
- A function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

#### - [4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/4-print_rev.c)
- A function that prints a string in reverse, followed by a new line.

#### - [5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/5-rev_string.c)
- A function that reverses a string.

#### - [6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/6-puts2.c)
- A function that prints one char out of two of a string, followed by a new line.

#### - [7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/7-puts_half.c)
- A function that prints the second half of a string, followed by a new line.

#### - [8. Arrays are not pointers](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/8-print_array.c)
- A function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

#### - [9. strcpy](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/9-strcpy.c)
- A function that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.

#### - [10. Great leaders are willing to sacrifice all for the freedom of their people](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/100-atoi.c)
- A function that converts a string to an integer.

#### - [11. Don't hate the hacker, hate the code](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/101-keygen.c)
- A program that generates random valid passwords for the program `101-crackme`.

#### - [12. It is not the strongest of the species that survives, but rather, the one most adaptable to change](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/holberton.h)
- A header file containing the function prototypes used in the various files.
