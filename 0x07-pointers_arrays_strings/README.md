# README FOR C - Even More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

## Learning Objectives:
* What are static variables
* What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
* What are command line arguments and how to use them
* What are two-dimensional arrays and how to use them

## This repository contains:

#### - [0. memset](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/0-memset.c)
- A function that fills the first `n` bytes of the memory area pointed to by `s` with the constant byte `b`.

#### - [1. memcpy](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/1-memcpy.c)
- A function that copies `n` bytes from memory area `src` to memory area `dest`.

#### - [2. strchr](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strchr.c)
- A function that locates a character in a string.

#### - [3. strspn](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/3-strspn.c)
- A function that gets the length of a prefix substring.

#### - [4. strpbrk](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/4-strpbrk.c)
- A function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.

#### - [5. strstr](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/5-strstr.c)
- A function that locates a substring.

#### - [6. Chess is mental torture](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/7-print_chessboard.c)
- A function that prints the chessboard.

#### - [7. The line of life is a ragged diagonal between duty and desire](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/8-print_diagsums.c)
- A function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

#### - [8. Double pointer, double fun](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/100-set_string.c)
- A function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.

#### - [9. My primary goal of hacking was the intellectual curiosity, the seduction of adventure](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/101-crackme_password)
- A file containing the password for the crackme program.

#### - [10. Arrays are not pointers](https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/holberton.h)
- A header file containing the function prototypes used in the various files.
