## Description

The 0x12-singly_linked_lists project is part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum. In this project, we explore the concept of singly linked lists and their usage in C.

A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element, called a node, contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the list. This arrangement allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements at the beginning or end of the list.

In this project, you will learn how to define and manipulate singly linked lists in C. You will implement various tasks that involve creating, traversing, modifying, and freeing linked lists. Through these tasks, you will gain a deeper understanding of linked lists and their practical applications.

## Project Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on different aspects of singly linked lists. The tasks include:

1. 0. Print list
2. 1. List length
3. 2. Add node
4. 3. Add node at the end
5. 4. Free list
6. 5. The Hare and the Tortoise

Each task involves writing C code that manipulates singly linked lists to achieve the desired functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with the 0x12-singly_linked_lists project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/saiss-ahmed/alx-low_level_programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the "0x12-singly_linked_lists" directory:
   ```
   cd alx-low_level_programming/0x12-singly_linked_lists
   ```

3. Explore the individual task files (e.g., "lists.h", "0-print_list.c", etc.) and implement the required code to complete each task.

4. Compile and run the C files to test your implementations.

5. Repeat the process for each task, making sure to check the task's requirements and expected output.

6. Once you have completed the tasks, you can submit your solutions for review and evaluation.

Feel free to experiment and explore additional use cases of singly linked lists to deepen your understanding.
